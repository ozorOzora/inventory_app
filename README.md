# How to run the app
You will need NodeJs to run the app.<br>
If you haven't installed NodeJs on your machine, you can [get it there](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Open your favorite command tool in the `Flowlity.Core` folder, and run `npm install`, this migh take a couple of minutes before completion.
Once it is done, run `node app.js`

The app is now accessible at http://localhost:3000 .
